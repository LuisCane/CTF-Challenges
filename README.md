# CTF Challenge Repo

## What is a CTF Challenge?
CTF or Capture the Flag is a hacking challenge to practice penetration and other cyber security skills. Services like Hack The Box, TryHackMe, and Vulnhub provide vulnerable virtual machines or "Boxes" to try to compromise. In addition to boxes, some of these services also provide challenges that focus on a specific skill like reverse engineering, scripting, or cryptography.

## Why this Repo?
I want to document my experiences with these CTF Challenges and be able to reference them if I come accross challenges that are similar to ones that I have already done.
As I do more challenges, I want to keep useful things here.
Some of the things I may include in this repository are:
- Scripts (bash, python, etc...)
- Writeups
- Notes
- Mock reports

## Spoiler Warning
**Warning**: This repository contains spoilers for various CTF challenges. If you haven't attempted these challenges yet and don't want to see solutions, please proceed with caution.
